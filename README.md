## 🏨 Overview

**Project Title:** Hotel Booker — MERN Stack Hotel Reservation System  
**Author:** Mohammed Ghanemi  

The Hotel Booker system is a full-stack web application that allows users to search, reserve, and manage hotel bookings online.  
It includes secure user authentication, dynamic booking management, admin control, and automated end-to-end testing.  

**QA Focus:** This project demonstrates advanced QA practices across **UI, API, functional, regression, integration, performance, and security testing**, using **Playwright**, **Postman**, and CI/CD automation.

## ✅ Testing Tools Used

I use **only one tool: Playwright**.  
Playwright is the core and only framework in my entire testing workflow.

---

### ✔ E2E Testing
Full end-to-end automation covering complete user flows from start to finish.

---

### ✔ UI Testing
Used Playwright for:
- Component validation  
- Form interactions  
- Visual checks  
- Navigation flows  
- DOM selector handling  

---

### ✔ API Testing
Performed API validation using Playwright’s built-in API features (`request` object) for:
- Sending requests  
- Validating responses  
- Testing backend logic without UI  

---

### ✔ Performance Testing
Used Playwright’s performance capabilities:
- Tracing  
- Page metrics  
- Network & response timing  
- Custom performance/load scripts  

---

### ✔ Security Testing
Implemented custom Playwright security tests for:
- Authentication  
- Authorization  
- Forbidden route access  
- Input sanitization  
- XSS attempts  
- CSRF-related behavior

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### 1️⃣ Functional Testing
Verify that each feature works as expected:
- Login & registration
- Booking creation, editing, deletion
- Admin approval  

**Tool:** Playwright E2E tests

---

### 2️⃣ UI Testing
- Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Responsive testing: Mobile, tablet, desktop
- Visual regression: screenshot comparison  

**Tool:** Playwright 

---

### 3️⃣ API Testing
- Test CRUD operations and authentication endpoints
- Validate response codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 500)
- Schema validation  

**Tools:** Playwright API testing

---

### 4️⃣ Regression Testing
- Re-run automated test suite on every release
- Ensure existing functionality remains intact  

**Tools:** Playwright

---

### 5️⃣ Integration Testing
- Test interaction between frontend & backend
- Test database integration
- Validate full API + UI flow  

**Tool:** Playwright E2E with real API endpoints

---

### 6️⃣ Performance Testing
- Load testing backend endpoints
- Measure response times and throughput  

**Tools:** playwright

---

### 7️⃣ Security Testing
- Test authentication & authorization
- Detect vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, JWT attacks)
- Use automated security scanners  

**Tools:** playwright

---


### 9️⃣ Reporting
- Generate HTML/JSON test reports
