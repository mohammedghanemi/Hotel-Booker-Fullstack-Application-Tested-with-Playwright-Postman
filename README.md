## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### 1️⃣ Functional Testing
Verify that each feature works as expected:
- Login & registration
- Booking creation, editing, deletion
- Admin approval  

**Tool:** Playwright E2E tests

---

### 2️⃣ UI Testing
- Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Responsive testing: Mobile, tablet, desktop
- Visual regression: screenshot comparison  

**Tool:** Playwright with screenshot assertions

---

### 3️⃣ API Testing
- Test CRUD operations and authentication endpoints
- Validate response codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 500)
- Schema validation  

**Tools:** Postman / Newman or Playwright API testing

---

### 4️⃣ Regression Testing
- Re-run automated test suite on every release
- Ensure existing functionality remains intact  

**Tools:** Playwright + CI/CD

---

### 5️⃣ Integration Testing
- Test interaction between frontend & backend
- Test database integration
- Validate full API + UI flow  

**Tool:** Playwright E2E with real API endpoints

---

### 6️⃣ Performance Testing
- Load testing backend endpoints
- Measure response times and throughput  

**Tools:** k6 or Artillery

---

### 7️⃣ Security Testing
- Test authentication & authorization
- Detect vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, JWT attacks)
- Use automated security scanners  

**Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Snyk, manual security checks

---

### 8️⃣ Accessibility Testing
- Validate that all pages are keyboard navigable
- Ensure form labels and ARIA attributes exist  

**Tools:** axe-core, Lighthouse

---

### 9️⃣ Reporting
- Generate HTML/JSON test reports
- Include screenshots of failed tests
- Track test coverage and CI/CD status badges

---
